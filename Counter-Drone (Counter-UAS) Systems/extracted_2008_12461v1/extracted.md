Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System(s) (C-UAS):

State of the Art, Challenges and Future Trends

Jian Wang, Yongxin Liu, and Houbing Song, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), often referred to as drones, have been
experiencing healthy growth in the United States and around the
world. The positive uses of UAS have the potential to save lives,
increase safety and efﬁciency, and enable more effective science
and engineering research. However, UAS are subject to threats
stemming from increasing reliance on computer and communica-
tion technologies, which place public safety, national security, and
individual privacy at risk. To promote safe, secure and privacy-
respecting UAS operations, there is an urgent need for innovative
technologies for detecting, tracking, identifying and mitigating
UAS. A Counter-UAS (C-UAS) system is deﬁned as a system or
device capable of lawfully and safely disabling, disrupting, or
seizing control of an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft
system. Over the past 5 years, signiﬁcant research efforts have
been made to detect, and mitigate UAS: detection technologies
are based on acoustic, vision, passive radio frequency, radar, and
data fusion; and mitigation technologies include physical capture
or jamming. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of
existing literature in the area of C-UAS, identify the challenges
in countering unauthorized or unsafe UAS, and evaluate the
trends of detection and mitigation for protecting against UAS-
based threats. The objective of this survey paper is to present
a systematic introduction of C-UAS technologies, thus fostering
a research community committed to the safe integration of UAS
into the airspace system.

I. INTRODUCTION
A

N unmanned aircraft system is an unmanned aircraft
(an aircraft that is operated without the possibility of
direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft)
and associated elements (including communication links and
the components that control the unmanned aircraft) that are
required for the operator to operate safely and efﬁciently in
the airspace system. Over the last 5 years, unmanned aircraft
systems (UAS), or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often
referred to as drones, have been experiencing healthy growth
in the United States and around the world [1]. According to
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aerospace forecast
ﬁscal years 2019-2039, the model UAS ﬂeet is set to grow
from the present 1.25 million units to around 1.39 million
units by 2023 and the non-model UAS ﬂeet is set to grow

from the present 277,000 aircraft to over 835,000 aircraft by
2023 [2]. The positive uses of UAS have the potential to
save lives, increase safety and efﬁciency, and enable more
effective science and engineering research [3]. These uses may
include modelers experimenting with small UAS, performing
numerous functions including aerial photography and personal
recreational ﬂying, commercial operators experimenting with
package and medical supply delivery and providing support
for search and rescue missions.

While the introduction of UAS in the airspace system has
opened up numerous possibilities, UAS can also be used
for malicious schemes by terrorists, criminal organizations
(including transnational organizations), and lone actors with
speciﬁc objectives. UAS-based threats stem from increasing
reliance on computer and communication technologies, plac-
ing public safety, national security, and individual privacy at
risk [4].

• Safety: Unsafe UAS operations involve operating UAS
near other aircraft, especially near airports; over groups
of people, public events, or stadiums full of people; near
emergencies such as ﬁres or hurricane recovery efforts; or
under the inﬂuence of drugs or alcohol [5][6]. Reports of
UAS sightings from pilots, citizens and law enforcement
have increased dramatically over the past ﬁve years [7].
A recent notable UAS incident was Gatwick Airport UAS
incident: Between December 19 and 21, 2018, hundreds
of ﬂights were cancelled at Gatwick Airport near London,
England, following reports of UAS sightings close to the
runway. The reports caused major disruption, affecting
approximately 140,000 passengers and 1,000 ﬂights [8].

• Security: Unsecure UAS operations involve operating
UAS over designated national security sensitive facilities,
such as military bases, national landmarks (such as the
Statue of Liberty, Hoover Dam, Mt. Rushmore), and cer-
tain critical infrastructure (such as nuclear power plants),
among others [9][10].

• Privacy: Privacy-invading UAS operations involve oper-
ating UAS with their camera on when pointing inside a
private residence [4][11][12].

To promote safe, secure and privacy-respecting UAS oper-
ations, there is an urgent need for innovative technologies
for detecting, tracking, identifying and mitigating UAS. A
counter-UAS (C-UAS) system is deﬁned as a system or device
capable of lawfully and safely disabling, disrupting, or seizing
control of an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system
[13]. Typically such a system is comprised of two subsystems:
one for detection and the other for mitigation [14][5]. The

ideal UAS detection subsystem, will detect, track, identify
an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system, have a
small footprint, and support highly automated operations. The
ideal UAS mitigation subsystem [13] will lawfully and safely
disable, disrupt, or seize control of an unmanned aircraft or
unmanned aircraft system [13], while ensuring low collateral
damage and low cost per engagement.

Due to the fact that UAS are aircraft without a human pilot
onboard that are controlled by an operator remotely or pro-
grammed to ﬂy autonomously, protecting against UAS-based
threats is very challenging. The challenges, which UAS can
present to critical infrastructure and several courses of action
that law enforcement and critical infrastructure owners and
operators may want to take, include: (1) the pilots of the UAS
are not able to receive commands from airspace authorities;
(2) the pilots of the UAS commonly take actions according
to video steams and GPS trajectories; (3) the communication
links between pilots and UAS are vulnerable to interference.

Over the past 5 years, a lot of research efforts have been
made to detect, track, identify and mitigate UAS: detection
technologies are based on acoustic [15], vision [16], passive
radio frequency (RF) [17], radar [18] and data fusion [19];
and mitigation technologies include physical capture (contain-
ment netting) [20], jamming (RF command and control (C2)
jamming and spooﬁng, or Global Positioning System (GPS)
jamming and spooﬁng) [21], and destruction (RF C2 intercept
and control) [22]. However, these efforts are not mature:
lack of scalability, modularity, or affordability. Innovative
technologies towards relatively mature scalable, modular, and
affordable approaches to detection and negation of UAS are
desired.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of existing
literature in the area of UAS detection and negation, identify
the challenges in countering adversary UAS, and evaluate the
trends of detection and negation for protecting against UAS-
based threats. The objective of this survey paper is to present a
systematic introduction of C-UAS technologies, thus fostering
a research community committed to the safe integration of
UAS into the airspace system.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion II presents various UAS-based threats and introduces
restrictions that commonly affect UAS ﬂights. Sections III
and IV presents the state of the art detection and mitigation,
respectively. Section V identiﬁes the challenges in countering
unauthorized or unsafe UAS. Section VI evaluates the trends
of detection and mitigation for protecting against UAS-based
threats. Section VII concludes this paper.

#### II. BACKGROUND

In this section, we discuss why we need UAS detection
and mitigation, different types of UAS-based threats, and the
common airspace restrictions applicable to UAS ﬂights.

A. Reported UAS Sightings

Over the past ﬁve years, reports of UAS sightings from pi-
lots, citizens and law enforcement have increased dramatically.
Each month the FAA receives more than 100 such reports. The

monthly UAS sightings between January 2014 and December
2019 are shown in Fig. 1, from which we could observe that
unsafe and unauthorized UAS operations have been increasing
dramatically. It is interesting that the most UAS sightings
occur in the summer months. The UAS sightings in each state
are shown in Fig. 2, from which we could observe that unsafe
and unauthorized UAS operations occur in most populated US
states.

B. UAS-based Threats

In this paper, we classify the UAS-based threats into three
categories: public safety, national security, and individual
privacy, as shown in Table I. UAS-based public safety threats
are due to operating UAS near other aircraft, especially near
airports; over groups of people, public events, or stadiums
full of people [6]; near emergencies such as ﬁres or hurricane
recovery efforts; or under the inﬂuence of drugs or alcohol;
UAS-based national security threats are due to operating UAS
over designated national security sensitive facilities, such as
military bases, national landmarks, and certain critical infras-
tructure, among others [9], [10]; UAS-based privacy threats
are due to operating UAS with their camera on when pointing
inside a private residence [4], [11].

1) Safety Threats: The unmanned nature of UAS operations
raises two unique safety concerns that are not present in
manned-aircraft operations: the pilot of the small UAS, who
is physically separated from it during ﬂight, may not have the
ability to see manned aircraft in the air in time to prevent
a mid-air collision, and the pilot of the small UAS could

#### TABLE III: Airspace Restrictions Applicable to UAS by FAA (March 2020)

Stadiums
Operations are prohibited within a radius of three nautical miles. Operations are
prohibited starting one hour before and ending one hour after scheduled time of
important events.
Airports
1. One must have a Remote Pilot Certiﬁcate and get permission from Air trafﬁc control
(ATC). 2. Model aeroclub organization must notify the airport operator and control
tower to ﬂy within 5 miles. 3. Public entity (law enforcement or government agency)
may apply for special permission.
Security sensitive airspace
Operations are prohibited from the ground up to 400 feet above ground level.
Capital areas
Varying according to the policies of government, in Washington, DC., airspace is
governed by a Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA), UAS operations are restricted within
a 30-mile radius of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (15-mile inner ring:
prohibitted without speciﬁc permission from FAA; 15 to 30 miles outer ring: registered,
light and small UAV can ﬂy lower than 400 feet and visual range in clear weather).
Restricted or Special Use
Airspace

Certain areas where drones and other aircraft are not permitted to ﬂy without special
permission, or where limitations must be imposed for any number of reasons.

lose control of it due to a failure of the communications link
between the small UAS and the pilot’s handset for controlling
the UAS [29]. Safety risks related to the use of UAS include
the potential for unintentional collisions between a small UAS
and a manned aircraft or other objects, causing damage to
property, or injury or death to persons [29]. Operating UAS
around airplanes, helicopters and airports is dangerous and
illegal.

2) Security Threats: UAS-related national security threats
may include [30]:

• Weaponized or Smuggling Payloads: Depending on
power and payload size, UAS may be capable of
transporting
contraband,
chemical,
or
other
explo-
sive/weaponized payloads.

• Prohibited Surveillance and Reconnaissance: UAS are
capable of silently monitoring a large area from the sky
for nefarious purposes.

• Intellectual Property Theft: UAS can be used to perform
cyber crimes involving theft of trade secrets, technologies,
or sensitive information.
3) Privacy Threats: UAS-based privacy threats lie in inten-
tional disruption or harassment. UAS may be used to disrupt
or invade the privacy of other individuals [30].

Some recent UAS-based threats are given in Table II,
which shows the time and location of threat occurrence, threat
category, and corresponding consequences.

C. Airspace Restrictions Applicable to UAS Flights

In the United States, there are several types of airspace
restrictions that commonly affect UAS ﬂights [31], as shown
in Table III. From the table, the most stringent restrictions
are security sensitive airspace restrictions which prohibit UAS
operations from the ground up to 400 feet above ground level,
and apply to all types and purposes of UAS ﬂight operations;

for stadiums and sporting events, restrictions are valid during
gathering of the crowds; Washington DC has the largest spatial
restriction circle (30 miles).

The FAA established a series of rules and regulations
which apply to UAS operations, based on the type of UAS
ﬂier: recreational ﬂiers and modeler community-based or-
ganizations, certiﬁcated remote pilots including commercial
operators, public safety and government, and educational users
[1]. UAS that weigh more than 0.55 pounds must be registered
with the FAA. In addition, ﬂying UAS that are less than 55
pounds for work or business requires remote pilot certiﬁcates
[1].

Although the FAA has established guidelines and regula-
tions, and reports of UAS sightings from pilots, citizens and
law enforcement have increased dramatically over the past ﬁve
years, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Therefore, there is an
urgent need for promoting safe, secure and privacy-respecting
UAS operations. We envision that an integrated system capable
of detecting and negating UAS will be essential to the safe
integration of UAS into the airspace system. Such a system
needs novel technologies in the following two main areas:

• Detection: The ideal UAS detection will detect, track
and identify an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft
system, have a small footprint, support highly automated
operations and location functions.

• Mitigation: The ideal UAS mitigation system will law-
fully and safely disable, disrupt, or seize control of an
unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system, while
ensuring low collateral damage and low cost per engage-
ment.
A survey of UAS detection and mitigation is the ﬁrst step in
leveraging communications and signal processing to develop
low footprint UAS detection solutions, in terms of size, weight,
power, and manning, as well as varied and low collateral
damage UAS mitigation techniques and effectors, towards safe
integration of UAS into the airspace system.

#### III. STATE OF THE ART UAS DETECTION

Since 2014, ﬁve technologies have been proposed for UAS
detection, including acoustic, vision, passive radio frequency,
radar, and data fusion. We summarized the evolution of UAS
detection technologies in Fig. 3, where different technologies
are ranked based on the popularity for each year. From the
ﬁgure, we know that data fusion approaches have been the
most popular technology for UAS detection while acoustic
based approaches have been the least popular. In this section,
we will introduce each UAS detection technology and discuss
its advantages and disadvantages.

A. Acoustic based UAS Detection

Acoustic based UAS detection leverages acoustic sensors
to capture the sound of UAS, identify and track the UAS
with audio. Acoustic sensor arrays, which are deployed around
the restricted areas, record the audio signal periodically and
deliver the audio signal to the ground stations. The ground
stations extract the features of the audio signal to determine
whether the UAS are approaching.

Conventionally, after receiving the audio signal of UAS,
the power spectrum or frequency spectrum will be analyzed
to identify the UAS. Vilímek, J. et al. adopted the linear
predictive coding to distinguish the sound of UAS engine from
the sound of car engine but the performance is subject to
weather conditions [32]. Kim, J. et al. designed a real-time
UAS sound detection and analysis system which could acquire
the real-time sound data from the sensor and recognize the
UAS [15]. Jang, B. et al applied the euclidean distance and
Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to distinguish the
UAV engine sound from the background sound and demon-
strated their effectiveness, even though the power spectrum of
the noise is larger than that of the UAS sound. However, in
practice, their processing efﬁciency is poor [33].

Due to light weight, low-cost and easy assembly, acoustic
sensors could be used to construct acoustic acquiring array and
deployed in the target area to locate and track the trajectories
of the UAS. An approach is proposed to deploy acoustic sensor
array which acquires the sound of engine in UAS. The acoustic
sensor array consists of 24 custom-built microphones which
locate and track the UAS collaboratively. They calibrated each
sensor with Time Delay Of Arrival (TDOA) and predicted
the UAS ﬂight path with beamforming. They could track
the ﬂight path well but this approach could not work well
in a large scale space, and the accuracy of the sensor is
dependent seriously on calibration [34]. Two arrays consists
of 4 microphone sensors to improve the capability of the
UAS localization. Due to the multipath effect, they provided
a Gauss prior probability density function to improve the
TDOA estimation. Their arrays could be deployed in speciﬁc
area efﬁciently and achieved good performance to track the
UAS. However, their system is not stable when it works for
a long time [35]. Advanced acoustic cameras are leveraged to
detect and track the UAS. To be speciﬁc, they used 2 to 4
acoustic cameras to capture the strength distribution of sound
and fused the strength distribution to compute the location of
the UAS indoors and outdoors [36]. An audio-assisted camera
array is deployed to detect the UAS, which captured the video
and audio signals at the same time and classiﬁed the object
with Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature and Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefﬁcents (MFCC) feature [37].

Different from the above conventional methods, signiﬁcant
research efforts have been made to leverage machine learning
to classify the UAS from audio data.Support Vector Machine
(SVM) is implemented to analyze the mid term signal of UAS
engine and constructed the signal ﬁngerprint of UAS. Their
results showed that the classiﬁer could precisely distinguish
the UAS in some scenarios [38]. An approach is proposed to
transform the detection of the presence of UAS to a binary
classiﬁcation problem, and used Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) to detect UAS. Their results showed
that could work well with the short input signal within 240ms
[39].

The current acoustic based UAS detection technologies
can recognize and locate the UAS precisely to meet the
accuracy requirement of UAS detection. However, the nature
of acoustic approaches limits the deployment and detection

of UAS in a large scale. Machine learning (ML) presents
a tremendous opportunity of integrating with the acoustic
sensing into acoustic based UAS detection for improved UAS
detection performance.

B. Passive RF based Detection

UAS usually maintain at least one Radio Frequency (RF)
communication data link to its remote controller to either
receive control commands or deliver aerial images. In this
case, the spectral patterns of such transmission are used as
an important evidence for the detection and localization of
UAS. Different passive RF technologies are shown in Fig. 4.
In most cases, Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR) receivers are
employed to intercept the RF channels.

To utilize the spectrum patterns of UAS, in [40], an Artiﬁcial
Neural Networks (ANN) detection algorithm for a UAS RF
signal was proposed which employs three signal features:
improved slope, improved skewness, and improved kurtosis.
It was shown that the proposed algorithm based on ANN
outperforms other recognition technologies of the improved
slope, skewness, and kurtosis of signal spectrum.

Data trafﬁc patterns are also an important feature to specify
UAS. In [41], a UAS detection and identiﬁcation system,
which utilized commercial off-the-shelf hardware to passively
listen to the wireless signal between UAS and their controllers
for packet transmission characteristics, was proposed. They
mainly extracted the packet length distribution of UAS and
evaluated the prototype system with three types of UAS. Their
experiment results demonstrated the feasibility of using the
data frame length to identify different UAS within 20 seconds.
The increasing amount of commercial UAS, using WiFi as
control and First Person View (FPV) video streaming protocol,

motivated the method in [17], a UAS detection approach based
on WiFi ﬁngerprint. The method identiﬁed the presence of
unauthorized UAS in a nearby area by monitoring the data
trafﬁc.

Data trafﬁc based methods or pure spectrum pattern methods
depends highly on the telemetry protocol or RF front-ends
of UAS. These methods may not be able to identify UAS
operating with unknown telemetry protocols. Therefore, some
researches focus on the use of the coupled kinetics motion
patterns of ﬂying UAS from their radio signal to specify
their presence. In [42] and [43], Matthan, a cost-effective
and passive RF-based UAS detection system was introduced.
Their system detected the presence of UAS by identifying
the unique signatures of its coupled vibration and shifting
patterns in the transmitted wireless signals. The joint detector
integrated evidence from both a frequency-based detector that
indicated UAS body vibration as well as a wavelet-based
detector that captured the sudden shifts of drone frame by
computing wavelets at different scales from the temporal RF
signal. A similar approach was also presented in [44].

Localization is also an important part of passive RF based
UAS detection. In [45], the authors divided the complete
detection procedure for UAS detection into RF spectrum
sensing and the Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimated. [46]
presented a useful experiment, which used commercial off
the shelf Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based SDR
system for detecting and locating small UAS. Their results
demonstrated that it is possible to develop a UAS detection
system capable of detecting small UAS with error of 50-75m
using commercial FPGA-based SDR system. The SDR system
with optimized clock synchronization would radically reduce
the measurement error in distance. How to implement robust
localization algorithms with acceptable accuracy on ubiquitous
hardware is still an open problem in passive RF detection
of UAS. How to deploy such passive RF based systems on
the ground stations or other UAS platforms is another open
problem in the detection of UAS.

C. Vision based UAS Detection

Vision based UAS detection technologies mainly focus on
image processing. Videos and cameras are adopted to capture
the images of trespassing UAS. The ground stations ﬁgure
out the appearance of UAS from the videos and pictures with
computational methods. Conventional methods mainly rely on

the methods of image segmentation. The differential of UAS
and environment in images is used to determine whether the
restricted areas have the UAS. A vision based UAS detection
approach is presented in [47], which could separate the UAS
from background efﬁciently. Similar work was reported in [48]
and [16]. The common challenges for their approaches are
how to separate UAS from background images and how to
distinguish UAS from ﬂying birds. Typical vision-based UAS
detection technologies are summarized in Figure 5.

In contrast, state-of-art image segmentation methods make
use of neural networks to directly identify the appearance of
UAS. An approach leverages the thermal camera to detect
the UAS and neural network to identify the UAS [49]. An
outstanding research is presented in [50]. A lightweight and
fast algorithm which could operate on embedded system
(Nvidia Jetson TX1) and identify the UAS in movement.

A real-time vision based UAS detection system is designed
which is based on two vision processing platforms: FPGA-
based platform, which can operate below 10 Watt (i.e., power
saving), and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based platform,
which is able to process more frames. However, for FPGA, it is
impossible to change algorithms in real time [51]. Muhammad,
S. et al. compared different convolutional neural networks’
performance in detecting UAS, and their results showed that
the Visual Geometry Group (VGG 16) network with Faster
R-CNN achieved outstanding performance [52]. An approach
is proposed to combine different pictures to generate synthetic
images to extend the image data set to train the convolutional
neural network to enhance the performance of the UAS
detection [53].

Birds are a serious factor which downgrades the identiﬁca-
tion of UAS from the images. Signiﬁcant research efforts have
been made to use convolutional neural networks to enhance the
identiﬁcation of UAS. Survey about the challenges of detection
of UAS and birds is presented in [54]. The survey concluded
that the neural network algorithms are promising in identifying
UAS and birds. It compared policy based approaches and neu-
ral network based algorithms for the recognition of birds and
UAS using datasets of videos and pictures. The results showed
that the neural network based approaches can outperform the
policy based approaches over 100 times in terms of accuracy
and efﬁciency. An UAS detection framework is presented in
[55], which is based on video streams and classiﬁed the objects
into different types with convolutional neural network. The

work mainly focused on distinguishing the birds and UAS in
different scenarios.

At the same time, some attempts were made to apply
infrared cameras to identify the UAS. Infrared sensors are
leveraged to detect small variations of UAS in heat to identify
the UAS. The drawback of this approach is that the heat
from batteries has signiﬁcant effects on result detection [56].
Different from other research on classifying the frame of
images, dynamic vision sensors are applied to capture the
rotating frequency of the propeller to distinguish the UAS from
birds efﬁciently [57].

Currently, the vision based approaches can be implemented
in some speciﬁc scenarios to recognize the features of UAS
from the environment. The evolution of deep neural networks
stimulated the processing of image processing which could
have multiple positive effects on the UAS detection in vision
ﬁeld. The real time attempts showed that the vision approaches
have the potentials of efﬁciency. However, how to implement
the recognized algorithms in multiple and variable environ-
ments is challenging. The novel approaches are supposed to
be robust, adjustable, and precise. The vision based approaches
need to be robust to the quick variation of the environment.
The image distortion caused by weather change could be
mitigated by the multiple level image processors which capture
the features of UAS in different spectrum. The mobility of
UAS poses a challenge to the vision based approaches, i.e.,
the images are supposed to be captured and recognized in
different levels of mobility of UAS. The bio-inspired robots
are limited in the detection accuracy, which poses the risk of
distinguishing of UAS and birds mistakenly. The enhanced
accuracy of the distinguishing can improve the efﬁciency of
UAS detection and mitigation greatly.

D. Radar based UAS Detection

Radars have several advantages in detecting airborne objects
compared with other sensors in terms of day and night oper-
ating capability, weather independency, and ability to measure
range and velocity simultaneously. However, regular radar
systems focus on ﬁghting air targets of medium and large
size with Radar Cross-Section (RCS) larger than 1 m2, which
makes it infeasible to detect small-size and low-speed UAS
in [18] and [58]. It is difﬁcult to detect UAS due to slow
speed, since Doppler processing is typically used. Therefore,
efforts are in needed to either develop new radar models
or increase the detective resolution of conventional systems.
In this section, we will discuss three categories of radar
based UAS detection technologies: Active detection, passive
detection and posterior signal processing.

1) Active Detection: Typically, there are two ways to in-
crease the resolution of conventional radar detection systems
for UAS surveillance: utilizing higher frequency carriers and
using Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) beamforming
radio front-ends.

To utilize shorter wave length, in [59] and [60], X-band
and W-band Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW)
radars are designed for UAS detection. Their solutions use bi-
static antenna and ﬁnally convert received signals into digital

quadrature stream for posterior processing. The feasibility of
using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) signals with 24GHz carrier
was demonstrated in [61]. The selection of carrier frequency
for UAS detection radar should be higher than 6GHz (K-band)
in [62] and [63].

Other approaches utilize multiple antennas to form MIMO
front-ends. The beneﬁt of such approach lies in its applicability
to radar system with lower carrier frequencies. [64] demon-
strated the detection of a small hexacopter using 32 by 8
element L-Band receiver array, which achieved good detection
sensitivity against micro-UAS. Similar research was presented
in [65], a ubiquitous FMCW radar system working at 8.75
GHz (X-band) with PC-based signal processor is presented.
The results indicated that it has the capability to detect a
micro-UAS at a range of 2 km with an excellent range-speed
association. In [66] a Ka-band radar system which uses 16
transmit and 16 receive antennas to form 256 virtual antenna
elements is presented. Their experiment proves that even in a
non stationary clutter environment, the UAS could be clearly
detected at a range of about 150m. Similar work was presented
in [67]. Another important characteristic of MIMO systems is
that they generate large quantity of data for further processing
in [68]. The authors use the concept of data cube and classiﬁer
to assure the presence and location on an incoming UAS. A
simpliﬁed approach, Multiple Input Single Output (MISO),
was utilized for UAS detection in [69].

Noise radar is considered to be an efﬁcient way to detect
the slow moving UAS and its beneﬁt is that UAS can be
detected by using simple antenna components and lower
carrier frequency. In [70] and [71], the feasibility of using
random sequence radar for UAS detection was demonstrated
in sub X-band, and their results indicate that such radar can
be the future of cost-efﬁcient UAS detection solutions.

The advances in computation enable another radar, the SDR
based multi-mode radar [72]. Such radar is small-size and
highly conﬁgurable. However, the operational performance of
SDR relies highly on the back-end processor. In [73], two
different implementations of FMCW radar and an implemen-
tation of continuous wave noise radar are presented to test
their feasibility for UAS detection. And their ﬁndings indicate
that the analog implementation has higher updating rate and
Signal Noise Ratio (SNR).

The apparent drawback of active radars is that they need
specially designed transmitters which might not be easy to
deploy and are vulnerable to anti-radioactive attacks.

2) Passive Radar: Passive radars do not require specially
designed transmitter. Existing radioactive sources such as
cellular signals can be leveraged to illuminate the space. In

this subsection, we classify passive radars into two categories:
single station passive radar and distributed synthetic passive
radar, as shown in Figure 7.

• Single station passive radar:
This type of passive radar exploits only one illumination
source. The variation of received signals can be analyzed
to specify the appearance of UAS. In [74], a WiFi based
passive radar was presented for the detection and 2D
localization of small aircraft. Obviously this is the most
direct adaptation of active radars.

• Distributed synthetic passive radar
Distributed station leverages the existing telecommunica-
tion infrastructures as illumination sources to enhance the
UAS detection. There are mainly two approaches: cellular
system based solutions and Digital Video Broadcasting
(DVB) system based solutions.

– Cellular system based passive radars: An approach

is proposed to enhance the detection system which
could locate and track the UAS by using reﬂected
Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)
signal [75]. An approach is proposed to receive the
3G cellular reﬂecting signal from UAS for track
UAS. He leveraged the Doppler features of 3G
cellular signal to monitor the target area and tracked
the trajectory of UAS. The results showed that UAS
could be tracked obviously in the waterfall data. The
drawback of this approach is that it needs a reference
receiver to calibrate the received signal. The accuracy
of detection is dependent on the calibration accuracy
seriously [76]. 5G mm-wave radar deployment in-
frastructure is constructed to detect amateur UAS.
The deployed radars capture the signal of amateur
UAS and upload it to cloud which could analyze
whether there exist hazards. This approach could be
an excellent approach in protecting safety of the city
if the challenges of resource management, Non-Line
Of Sight (NLOS) radar operation, noise mitigation
and big data management could be addressed [77].
Similar implementation was presented in [78], where
a passive radar array system is proposed to receive
and process the Orthogonal Frequency Division Mul-
tiplexing (OFDM) echoes of UAS, which is origi-
nally transmitted by the nearby base stations.
– Digital video broadcasting system based passive

radars: The pervasive digital television signals are
considered as an efﬁcient illumination source for
passive drone detection radars. In [79], [80] and [81],
passive drone detection radars were designed and

tested.
Similar to active radar approaches, the micro-Doppler effect
could be employed. In [82], UAS classiﬁcation tests were
conducted through propeller-driven micro Doppler signature
and machine learning. Their experiment reveals that the micro
Doppler signature of a plastic propeller is much less visible
than carbon ﬁber propeller.

An apparent drawback for passive radar is that large amount
of post processing efforts or multiple receivers are needed to
achieve acceptable detection accuracy.

3) Posterior Signal Processing: In UAS detection, efforts
are needed to derive weak and sparse reﬂection signals of
targets from noisy output of RF front-ends. Researches in
this domain can be classiﬁed into two categories: conven-
tional signal feature based detection and learning-based pattern
recognition. The general categorization of radar signal is given
in Figure 8.

Fig. 8: Categorization of radar signal processing.

1) Signal feature based detection
The micro-Doppler effect of propellers of UAS are
proved to be a useful feature of UAS detection. In [83]
and [84] methods for estimation of small-size UAS are
discussed, with focus on the micro-Doppler signatures of
rotating rotor blades. Their experiments proved that such
feature can be used to distinguish UAS from other ﬂying
objects. In [85], a method based on hough transform
was proposed to improve the detection and tracking
performance. By making use of the linear distributed
micro Doppler features, the method is able to detect and
recognize UAS simultaneously. The micro-Doppler ef-
fect caused by ﬂying UAS can also be used for detection
of multiple UAS in [86], where the time–frequency spec-
trogram is converted into the Cadence-Velocity Diagram
(CVD). And then the Cadence Frequency Spectrum
(CFS), as the basis of training data from each class,
is extracted from CVD. K-means classiﬁer is used to
recognize the component of multiple micro–UAS based
on the CFS. Their experimental results on real radar data
demonstrated that their method is capable of handling
multiple UAS with satisfactory classiﬁcation accuracy.
2) Learning based pattern recognition
Learning based pattern recognition methods is capable
of classifying various types of objects. An example
of conventional classiﬁcation methods was presented
in [87]. This research demonstrated a classiﬁcation
experiment of UAS versus non-UAS tracks, based on
a mixture of bird, aircraft and simulated UAS tracks,
which is mainly based on the statistical features of the
tracks and yields a high accuracy rate. Neural network
based methods employ deep learning techniques to au-

tomate the feature engineering process of conventional
machine learning. In [88], the UAS detection is carried
by a CNN which learns the characteristic features in
the 2D distribution of the Doppler spectrogram with
high classiﬁcation accuracy. In [89], the Deep Belief
Networks (DBN) are applied to characterize the features
embodied by generated Spectral Correlation Functions
(SCF) patterns to detect and identify different types of
UAS automatically. The results of experiment illustrate
that the proposed system is able to detect and classify
micro UAS effectively. The validation of their approach
using cognitive radio is given in [90]. The beneﬁt of
learning based pattern recognition approach is that such
systems are programmable and trainable to adapt to
various scenarios.
Radar based UAS detection can achieve better detection per-
formance than the current other sensors. The antennas and
signal processors were always considered as expensive options
for the implementations. Though radar based approaches can
achieve the better performance of the UAS detection (Long
distance and Short distance), their cost is high in terms of
deployment, calibration and maintenance. The manipulation
of the radar based approaches requires the technicians to
have the relative background of radar operations which poses
a signiﬁcant challenge to ubiquity in a large scale. The
light, energy-saving, affordable and easy assembling radar
element is desired which is supposed to be capable of easy
deployment and maintenance. The posterior signal processing
algorithms fueled by machine learning show great potentials
to improve the efﬁciency and the accuracy of UAS detection.
The improved capacity of reduced overhead of portable signal
processing algorithms can expand the implementations of
radar based UAS detection.

E. Data-fusion-based UAS Detection

Data fusion, which is the process of integrating multiple
data sources to produce more consistent, accurate, and useful
information than that provided by any individual data source,
has the potential to generate fused data which is more infor-
mative and synthetic than the original inputs. The data fusion
approaches can leverage the advantages of each method to
acquire a combined result that is more robust, accurate and
efﬁcient than the single approaches. For the UAS detection,
data fusion can be used to improve the performance of the
UAS detection system to overcome the disadvantages of the
single approach which exist in some speciﬁc scenarios.

Based on the above discussion, the disadvantages and the
advantages of each approach have been presented. The ﬁrst
general problem of the single approach is that limitation of the
detection range and accuracy. The second general problem of
the single approach is the vulnerability to detection scenarios.
The third general problem of the single approach is the
efﬁciency of the computation. Based on the above general
problems, the research on the data fusion based UAS detection
(shown as Fig.9), can be classiﬁed into three categories: 1)
Multiple-Sensor Data Fusion; 2) Multiple-Type Sensor Data
Fusion; 3) Multiple Sensing Algorithm Fusion.

Fig. 9: Data fusion based UAS detection

1) Multiple-Sensor Data Fusion
Each type of sensors have their own advantages and
disadvantages in the UAS detection scenarios. The
general problem of the single approach is the limited
detection range. The more straight and efﬁcient approach
to improve the performance of the single approach
is designing a speciﬁc type of sensors to avoid the
drawbacks of nature materials.
A classical example is acoustic sensor array. Distributed
acoustic sensors are deployed in the detection areas.
Each sensor can record the audio and deliver the record
to the ground stations to make a combination evaluation
of the environment in sound spectrum [91]. The re-
searchers extracted the phrase difference in the sound to
locate the UAS. In the signal processing, the researchers
need to adjust the weight of each sensor to obtain
the higher accuracy of the location. Apart from the
accuracy of detection, the data fusion can improve the
functions of UAS detection. The RF based detection can
acquire the RF signal with omni-directional antennas.
The researchers could adjust the detection phrase of
the signals in the receiving processing with multiple
omni-directional antennas. Thereafter, the system with
omni-directional antennas could acquire signals in the
speciﬁc direction [17], [92]. This function could enable
the ground stations to track trajectories of UAS and
determine whether the UAS has the malicious intentions.
The combined function also could enlarge the range of
UAS detection which can not be gained by the single an-
tenna. The multiple sensor approaches combine multiple
sensors with the same type to obtain the better accuracy
or additional functions to improve the performance of
the UAS detection. The combination of the multiple
sensors extends the capacity of the single sensor and
maximize the range of detection geographically.
2) Multiple-Type Sensor Data Fusion
In some scenarios, the improvement on the amount can
not mitigate the disadvantages of the single sensors.
Different UAS detection approaches are tested in [48].
The acoustic sensors are sensitive to the humidity, the
temperature and the vibration in the environment. The
cameras are invalid when the sunlight project on the
lens directly. And the RF antennas are hard to recog-
nize the target signal when it is buried in the white
Gaussian noise environment. More speciﬁcations can
be found in [48]. They concluded that the fusion of
acoustic and radar could give more precise detection

than other approaches. The conventional single sensors
can not achieve outstanding performance on a variable
environment, and meet multiple requirements of UAS
detection ranges.
Concurrently, the cost of developing high quality func-
tional sensors is prohibitively high. The researchers
resort to the combination of different types of sen-
sors. Based on the disadvantages and the advantages
of each type of sensors, the researchers could combine
different types of sensors to achieve the accuracy and
long distance detection. Long and short range detec-
tion technologies are combined, where the passive RF
receivers detect UAS’s telemetry signals while video
and acoustic sensors are used to increase the detection
accuracy in the near ﬁeld. Different range sensor systems
including acoustic, optic and radars are integrated for
UAS detection in target area. They deployed a 120-
node acoustic array which use acoustic camera to locate
and track the UAS, and 16 high revolution optical
cameras to detect the UAS in the middle distance. In
the long distance, they adopted MIMO radar to operate
3 different band radars to achieve remote detection [93].
The resulting combination overcomes the drawbacks of
each type of sensors on the UAS detection and maximize
the advantages of each type of sensors. Simultaneously,
the combination reduced the cost of deploying sensors
in a large scale. In [93], the deployment of cameras
can meet the middle distance detection requirement and
reduce the cost on the deployment of acoustic sensors
and radars.
The combination of different types of sensors could
achieve an outstanding performance for the restricted
areas. However, the deployment and the conﬁgura-
tion of this approach require much more speciﬁc and
professional technologies and technicians with related
backgrounds to maintenance. The different type sensor
combination is a promising approach to maximize the
capacity of sensors in the physical levels. In the fu-
ture, investigation should be focused on exploring more
combinations and characteristics of different sensors for
more robust, affordable solutions.
3) Multiple Sensing Algorithm Fusion
The conventional approaches of data fusion fuse multi-
ple data acquired from the sensors. Many data fusion ap-
proaches had maximized the capacity of sensors greatly.
However, for UAS detection, the efﬁciency and the
accuracy still can not meet the requirement. The novel
approaches are needed to combine the multiple sensing
algorithms to achieve the efﬁciency and the accuracy
required by UAS detection. The sensing algorithms
could be triggered according to the status of detection.
The activated sensors deliver the information to the
ground stations. Thereafter, the ground stations set the
status of the detection, and the relevant algorithms will
be swapped into the processing to extract the features of
the target information. The UAS detection system will
generate the threat outcome according to the result of
sensing algorithms.

In this part, the sensing algorithms receive the data
delivered from the sensors and extract the target features
according to the types of sensors. The UAS detection
system can adjust the sensing algorithm accuracy to meet
the requirement of detection once the abnormal signals
are detected. In [91], the researchers leverage the unsu-
pervised approaches to extract the features of signal from
various acoustic sensors under different scenarios (bird,
airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and UAS). Based on
the recognition of scenarios, the system, proposed in
this research, triggers support vector machine (SVM)
and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), separately, to detect
the amateur drones in the restricted areas. To achieve
the tracking efﬁciency, the authors, in [94], [95], [96],
[97], implemented multiple sensing algorithms on the
passive mm-wave radar system to achieve the different
accuracy of tracking according to the requirement of the
recognition.
The combination of the multiple sensing algorithms
could achieve advantages of the efﬁciency, the accuracy,
less overhead of system and etc. according to the re-
quirement of the UAS detection. However, how to make
a reasonable arrangement for the sensing algorithms still
needs more efforts. And the reasonable schedules of
sensing algorithms can be a stimulation for the UAS
detection system in the future.
Other data fusion schemes can be based on different plat-
form integration. The researchers deploy multiple sensors into
different platforms to leverage the mobility of different plat-
forms, thus maximizing the sensors’ capacities. The authors
deployed the cameras on the surveillance UAS to make sure
the amateur drones entering the restricted areas after the
deployed acoustic sensors, in the sensing areas, send alarms to
the ground stations [98]. In this research, they could recognize
different targets such as birds.

The data fusion approaches combine the advantages of
each approach in the detection. The attempts show that the
data fusion approaches have obvious advantages compared
with single methods. According to the characteristics of each
type of approaches, the detection deployment could contain
multiple schemes in different areas which is apart from the
center restricted areas in distance differently. Thereafter, how
to implement the data fusion algorithms to achieve the con-
sistency of the detection system on the results will be next
challenge. Another challenge of the data fusion approaches
is how to balance the weight of each approach in the ﬁnal
decision to achieve optimal detection results.

The distinction of “capture and retrieve”and “disable and
drop”is important. Most malicious UAS are captured by the
defenders with physical capture, Directional EMP, RF jam-
ming and Hacking. However, only the technologies of RF
jamming and hacking can realize the function of retrieve.
The retrieve function is supposed to be robust, accurate and
efﬁcient. The defenders are supposed to be conﬁdent that their
systems have high probabilities of retrieving the malicious
UAS again with protection of the property and the public. For
the “disable and drop”, only the physical capture methods just
drop the UAS from the ﬂight. The technologies of Directional

EMP, RF jamming and hacking have the both capacities of
disabling and dropping. The Directional EMP, RF jamming
and hacking can disable the UAS sensors, circuit, control
system and communication devices to disable the control from
remote attackers. However, these technologies can go deeper,
like damaging control circuit and control algorithms, that can
drop the UAS from the ﬂight directly.

#### IV. STATE OF THE ART MITIGATION

The technologies of detection and mitigation are still im-
mature. The research on UAS mitigation is limited. David
etc. [99] developed an architecture of UAS defense system.
In this architecture, they speciﬁed the effective engagement
range, including initial target range, detection range and
neutralization range which is dominant for response. And
their report showed that when the range is over 4,000 feet,
the hardware based reaction and neutralization could operate
efﬁciently. Based on the architecture, the approaches could be
classiﬁed into three main categories, as shown in Fig. 10. The
ﬁrst one is the physical capture which focuses on capturing
UAS with physical methods. The second is to leverage the
noise generator to jam the systems or sensors, thus rendering
the UAS inoperable by the UAS controller. The third is to
exploit vulnerabilities of system or sensors to acquire priority
of control.

trigger the net to catch UAS. The net is stretched when
the net is shot, and closed to disable the mobility of
drone when the net touches the drone. Kilian etc. [100]
invented a deployable net capture system which could
be installed in the airplane or authenticated UAS. When
the unauthorized or unsafe UAS are located, the system
could capture the unauthorized or unsafe UAS. Practical
approaches to neutralize UAS are attracting attentions
of the military. In [20], a spin launched UAS projectile
is developed. This projectile aims to launch a net to
capture a ﬂying UAS. The net is stored in the warhead
of projectile which allow soldiers to shoot it by regular
guns.

restart or disable the operation of control system. Based
on the function of electromagnetic pulse, Gomozov
etc. [22] focus on the functional neutralization of on-
board radio electronic system on UAS, and they adopted
spatio-temporal pulse of the wavelength λ = 2.5cm to
neutralize the UAS and their results showed that their
approach could provide an aimed impact on UAS in
the range from 0.5 to 1 km and no harm to biological
protection.
The physical capture mainly focuses on disabling the mobility
of drone and control system. The physical capturing ap-
proaches have advantages of easy manipulation, light weight,
quick assembling, etc. Once the drone is captured by the
physical capturing approaches, the drone will experience dam-
ages at different levels. The physical capturing approaches are
efﬁcient and low cost, but not friendly to pilots.

B. Jamming

Jamming is the most popular method used in neutralizing
UAS entering restricted areas. The defenders leverage noise
signal to interfere operation of UAS sensors or systems for
neutralization. In this subsection, we classify jamming into
three main categories, as shown in Fig. 11. Among these attack
methods, the main targets are UAS sensors and systems. Zhao
etc. [101] proposed an approach to leverage a team of UAS
to form an air defense radar network which could jam the
targets’ sensors. This approach could detect and negate the
unauthenticated UAS and their experimental results showed
that they could track and jam the phantom made by DJI to
leave the restrict areas, and proofed that the N UAS, in a team,
could negate at most N ×(N −1) targets. Li etc. used the direct
track deception and fusion to invade the control priority of
navigation system and trajectory control system. Based on the
GPS deception jamming theory, they leveraged the trajectory
cheating to lead the unauthenticated UAS to ﬂy out from the
restricted areas. Their results showed that both the direct track
and the fusion track could make UAS drift off the restricted
areas. Pärlin etc. [21] proposed an approach to use the SDR
to realize a protocol-aware UAS jamming system. They used
an SDR to achieve remote controller’s signal and recognized
the communication protocol with analysis. The SDR generates
command to control the UAS to ﬂy away restricted areas.
They compared three different approaches (Tone, Sweep and
Protocol-Aware) to evaluate the performance of their approach
which showed that the protocol-aware is more efﬁcient than
tone and sweep jamming.

• Tone: a narrow band signal at the center of a single
channel.

• Sweep: a linear chirp swept across the entire 2.4 GHz
ISM band.

• Protocol-Aware: a signal imitating either Futaba Ad-
vanced
Spectrum
Spread
Technology
(FASST)
and
Advanced
Continuous
Channel
Shifting
Technology
(ACCST).
Li etc. [102] proposed an approach to leverage the UAS with
jammer to neutralize other UAS eavesdroppers. They used
the mobility of UAS to get close to malicious UAS and the
jammer installed on the UAs could impact the malicious UAS’
trajectories. Sliti etc. [103] presented different attacks which
focus on UAS network for neutralization.

• Jamming attack: Transmitting a jamming signal to disrupt
communications between a drone and the pilot, forcing
the drone to return to â ˘AIJhomeâ ˘A˙I location, i.e., where
it took off.

• Black hole attack: a type of denial-of-service attack which
discards the incoming or outgoing trafﬁc of communica-
tion.

• Replay attack: a network attack that vises to maliciously
repeat a valid communication so that the communication
of the UAS could be analyzed and invaded.
Curpen etc. [104] focus on neutralizing the UAS which is
based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. The spectrum
analysis in two different cell networks showed that the efﬁcient
jamming range for LTE UAS is approximated 60m. Mototolea
etc. [105] leveraged the SDR to analyze and hijack the small
UAS. In this work, the decoding protocol of DSM2 could get
the ﬁngerprinting and pairing process. Willner [106] invented
a system which could neutralize remotely explosive UAS in a
combat zone. This system could be equipped on the ground
or installed on the authenticated UAS which transmit the
jamming signal once the target is locked. Bhattacharya etc.
[107] developed a game theoretic approach to optimize the
jamming method on the expelling the UAS attacker.

Jamming approaches can provide friendly and zero-damage
schemes to neutralize the drone entering the restricted areas.
The jamming approaches can provide the neutralizing effects
on the drones in different levels (from hardware to software).
The jamming can be deployed in a large scale and take effect
for a long time. However, the current jamming can not make
a directional effect which can be controlled by the defenders.
The effects of jamming is omni-directional which could affect
the devices in the restricted areas, and energy consuming. The
jamming needs a long time to take effects when the drone
receives enough jamming signals. In the coming future, the
jamming is supposed to be controlled, directional and quickly
reactions.

C. Vulnerabilities

There are three main methods to exploit the UAS vulnera-
bilities, as shown in Fig 12. Most vulnerabilities exploitation
work focus on GPS control using sensors and communication
protocol. The defenders leverage the spooﬁng methods to GPS
and control using sensors, and adopt modiﬁcation and invading
to control using sensors and communication protocol. Rodday
etc. [108] demonstrated an approach to exploit the identiﬁed

vulnerabilities of the UAS control systems and performed
Man-in-the-Middle attack to inject the control commands to
interact with the UAS. Dey etc. [109] presented cracking SDK,
reversing engineering and GPS spooﬁng to hijack the UAS.
They compared the DJI and Parrot drone performances under
the exploitation attack. The results showed that the DJI is more
secure than Parrot, which means that the DJI is hard to rush
into the restricted area. Chen etc. [110] analyzed the popular
altitude estimation algorithms utilized in navigation system of
UAS and proposed several effective attacks ( shown as IV-C
) to the vulnerabilities.

• KF-based Sensor Fusion
1) Maximum false data injection: modifying the cal-
culation functions of GPS and barometer measure-
ments.

• Altitude estimation based on accurate sensor noise models
1) Blocking GPS: Disable the GPS readings.
2) Modifying barometer readings: Manipulating the
barometer and inject bad data.

• First-order Low-pass ﬁlter: Inject the barometer readings
and inﬂuence the accuracy of estimation.
Esteves etc. [111] demonstrated a simulation on a locked
target to gain access to the internal sensors for neutralizing
the UAS from restricted areas. Melamed etc. ﬁled a patent
on how to utilize the SDR with antenna array to detect the
UAS and create override signal to link of communication
to neutralize the UAS. Marty [112] presented an approach
to hijack the MAVLink protocol on the ArduPilot Mega 2.5
autopilot. Katewa etc. [113] proposed a probabilistic attack
model to neutralize the UAS which executed denial of service
attack against a subset of sensors based on Bernoulli process.
They also described the vulnerabilities on the sensors of the
UAS and strategies to negate the UAS via jamming sensors or
access control systems. Huang etc. [114] proposed a spooﬁng
attack based on the physical layer to utilize the angle of arrival,
distance-based path loss, and the Rician−κ factor to recognize
the UAS and source where the signal comes from.

Penetrating vulnerabilities of system has affected the pro-
cessing of security in computer ﬁeld for a long time. The

evolution of the amateur drones enables the drones have their
own Operation System (OS) which gives the defenders a
great chance to exploit the system via the vulnerabilities of
OS. The integration of embedded system and sensors extends
the vulnerabilities of the OS of drones. The vulnerabilities
releasing of the OS for the drones could improve the success
of exploit the unauthorized drones with malicious intentions
in the future.

For the deployment of detection technologies, the deploy-
ment decides the capacity of each type of approach signiﬁ-
cantly. According to the nature of sensors, the deployment on
ground based stations, UAS or manned aircraft are varying.
The acoustic sensors are sensitive to the sound which needs
the environment noise keeps stable and quiet. This means the
acoustic sensors are not suitable for the mobile platforms. The
passive RF based detection has speciﬁc requirement of the
antennas distance between each other which is important to
achieve accurate result for passive RF signal detection. The
passive RF based detection needs the platform have powerful
computation capacity which are just for the ground based
stations and manned aircraft. The current UAS can not provide
suitable computation and power supply. The vision based
detection can be deployed on the ground based stations, UAS
and manned aircraft. The key sensor of vision based detection
are mainly cameras. Meanwhile, a number of light weight, low
energy consumption cameras are suitable for the deployment
of vision based detection. The current radar based detection
has the disadvantages of heavy weights which is a challenge
for the mobile UAS platform. The payload and power supply
of the UAS are limited which can not satisfy the require-
ment of radar. The most cases of the deployment of radar
based UAS detection are ground based stations and manned
aircraft. The most fancy approaches are the data fusion based
detection which are just constrained by computation capacity.
Concurrently, the data fusion based detection approaches are
mainly implemented in the ground based stations and manned
aircraft. Apart from the above, the combination of different
platforms also has promising potentials to improve the capacity
of detection for big properties. The different deployment on
the ground based stations, UAS and manned aircraft could
achieve scalable detection to malicious UAS.

#### V. CHALLENGES IN UAS DETECTION AND MITIGATION

Tables IV and V compare various UAS detection and mitiga-
tion technologies, respectively. On one hand, millimeter wave
radar along with data fusion methods are considered as the
most promising trends for UAS detection in the future, on the
other hand, physical capture is regarded as the most practical
and reliable approach to neutralize unwelcome UAS. Hacking
and spooﬁng have emerged as a promising negation solution
with low footprint and low collateral damage. However, there
are a lot of challenges which must be addressed to develop
mature scalable, modular, and affordable approaches to UAS
detection and negation. In this section, we will identify the
challenges of each UAS detection or negation technology.

A. UAS Detection

1) Acoustic based UAS Detection: The piezoelectric sub-
strate materials are the core of the acoustic sensors. These ma-
terials could generate the electricity according to the strength
of vibration on the surface which is very smart characteristics.
But these materials also could be affected by the temperature,
humidity and light intensity. In practice, it is hard to keep a
stable performance of the detection when the scenario is full
of multiple variable physical parameters. At the same time,
the acoustic sensors are sensitive to the vibration of the air
caused by wind. The real UAS signal with the multiple fading
effect may be buried in the wind. The acoustic sensor array
can improve the accuracy of detection, and multiple sensors in
different places could locate the position of the UAS, but there
is limited research which takes into account Doppler effect
generated by the movement of the UAS, and the combination
effect of the movement of wind when the speed of wind is over
5 m/s, because the effect caused by wind is not negligible.
2) Passive RF based UAS Detection: The passive RF needs
multiple antennas to form an antenna array and recognize
the UAS according to the combination of each antenna’s
detection results. The passive RF detection methods are highly
dependent on the telemetry protocol and RF front-ends. A
novel approach which could recognize multiple protocols
simultaneously are needed. And such an approach is supposed
to be efﬁcient, stable and easily deployed in mobile embedded
devices. To our knowledge, there are no SDR speciﬁcally
designed for UAS detection available on the market. Cur-
rently SDR devices suffer from heavy weight, high energy
consumption, and poor potability, which limits the use of SDR
in UAS detection. How to design a light-weight, small-size,
and low cost RF analysis device with comparable or better

performance could be a signiﬁcant improvement for the UAS
detection. At last, the artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), like deep
learning, could be a good approach to improve accuracy and
robustness of the RF based detection methods. With the plenty
of signal data generated per second feeding, the deep learning
has the potential to improve the accuracy and efﬁciency. The
emergency of the RF signal in different small scales is very
important for efﬁcient and accurate recognition for UAS.

3) Vision based UAS Detection: Although vision detection
has been investigated for a long time, research efforts are still
needed to improve their performance. Firstly, there is a urgent
need for a vision device designed for UAS detection to be
light-weight, small-size, and low cost. The most important
issue is that how to adjust the aperture of the camera to
avoid the fading effect caused by sunlight in different angles.
Secondly, the shape of birds is very similar to some ﬁxed wing
UAS, and many bionic robots could ﬂy like birds. It is urgent
to classify these two scenarios in the mobile devices, especially
these devices could be installed in the surveillance UAS. So
combining some additional biological signals in the detection
process is needed to recognize these two different situations.
Thirdly, the deep learning has been applied in vision detection
for many years, but low size, weight and power-consumption
(SWaP) deep learning algorithms are still needed. The portable
deep learning algorithms could be implemented into a new
scenario without too much time training. In the computation
ﬁeld, this function of deep leaning is called transfer learning.
The mature and outstanding models of deep learning can
be implemented to multiple scenarios to achieve excellent
performances with few training episodes.

4) Radar based UAS Detection: There have been signiﬁcant
research efforts made on the radar based UAS detection. The

grounded radar could well meet the requirement of UAS
detection in military. But for the civilian usage of the UAS
detection in the scenarios like stadiums and residential areas,
the current schemes are not easy and fast to be deployed in the
places with the crowds. Most radars are highly dependent on
the antennas which are very huge and lack of ﬂexibility. The
light-weight, small-size and mobile based phrase array radars
for UAS usage have potentials to meet the requirement of
deploying in the civilian scenarios. This radar also needs to be
low-cost, because UAS does not allow the energy consuming
equipment to be on board. Another challenge for the radar
is how to solve the interference between the radar and other
communication equipment on the UAS. Based on advanced
radar detection equipment, there also needs an optimized de-
ployment approach to change the radar deployment according
to the change of scenarios in real time. Of course, the fast
and accurate radar analysis approaches also can make a great
improvement of the detection of the UAS.

5) Data Fusion based UAS Detection: Multiple signals
fuse from different detection devices which have different
data format. The traditional methods perform well on the
different data in the same acquisition accuracy, but can not
fuse well in different acquisitions. To detect unauthorized or
unsafe UAS, the surveillance needs to fuse multiple data from
different devices including video, radio, and audio, and so
on. A novel fusion approach could input the data in different
formats simultaneously and easily port in different embedded
systems.

B. UAS Mitigation

1) Physical Capture: The physical capture is the most
direct way to counter unauthorized or unsafe UAS, which is
easy to be deployed. So the requirement of the physical capture
methods is light-weight, variable scale, and easy to master.

• The physical capture needs to be light so that the human
being could carry it and get ready to take down the
UAS once they make sure that the UAS is unauthorized
or unsafe. Also, the surveillance UAS could install the
equipment and the surveillance UAS could counter the
intrusion UAS when they are patrolling.

• The physical capture needs to be variable scale so that it
could work when there are many different styles of UAS
in size. In the current, the most effect approach is net, but
the net also needs to be optimized which should be light,
ﬁrm and recyclable. The beneﬁt of the net is that it could
capture all the things in the capacity of net. Apart from the
net, the bolas also works well when capture the UAS. The
bolas is made of weights on the ends of interconnected
cords which is efﬁcient when the target has frames or
propellers. The power system of the most UAS is based
on the propeller. The bolas could be a powerful tool to
stop the UAS working if the rope is strong enough. The
net and bolas both need to be designed in variable scale
so that they could be used to capture UAS in different
sizes.

• The physical capture should be easy to master. The
physical capture tools like nets and bolas, could be

loaded into an easy trigger platform like bullets so that
a proper shooting gun could trigger the bullets to the
target and capture UAS. The surveillance UAS just carry
a light and simple trigger platform without much energy
consumption. To improve the successful capturing rate,
the physical capture methods needs assistance of the
navigation and tracking systems like missiles.

2) Directional EMP: The directional EMP is a very ef-
ﬁcient weapon to counter the UAS which could navigate
itself by Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) without any com-
munication with outer facilities. The main challenges of the
directional EMP are no harm to human being, low divergence
angle and long distance effect.

• Most EMP shooting contains too much electromagnetic
energy so that it also has damage effect on the other
nearby facilities or human beings. To make the EMP
shooting approaches more practical, the researchers need
to ﬁnd a proper frequency that take efﬁcient effect on
UAS and zero damage to organism. Because the organism
obtains the electromagnetic materials, if the EMP fre-
quency is similar to the respond frequency to the humans
or animals, the organism will take response to the speciﬁc
frequencies. We need to make sure that the EMP weapons
work in a different frequency from human and animal
response.

• The EMP is high power weapon which needs much
electricity to drive the EMP. However, the divergence
angle of the EMP wave will cause the much fading of
energy when it has effects on the target. So the research
needs to reconsider how to minimize the divergence angle
of the wave. The narrow divergence angle of the wave
could improve the success rate of countering UAS while
saving power.

• There is a disadvantage of the EMP. Different frequen-
cies have different transmission distances. The higher
frequency EMP will disappear more quickly in the air
while the higher frequency EMP obtains more energy
which improves the counter successful rate. So there is
an embarrassing problem: when the target is detected
but the counter distance is limited. How to balance the
frequency and distance to achieve a better performance
of the counter purpose is desired.

3) RF Jamming: The current RF Jamming approaches have
the following disadvantages. First, the RF jamming consumes
too much power which is not practical for surveillance UAS
to carry to execute the RF jamming precisely. Second, RF
jamming works for an area, however the RF jamming could
not jam a speciﬁc target in a desired point. The RF jamming
only takes effect when the UAS are communicating with outer
devices. The RF jamming does not work if the UAS navigates
itself with inner global navigation system (GPS).

• The current RF jamming devices are deployed on the
ground or mobile vehicles which have limited movement
space to generate the efﬁcient jamming signals to interfere
the UAS communication system. Also these devices are
too heavy to be loaded on the surveillance UAS. So the
light-weight, high efﬁcient and low cost RF jamming

devices are required, especially the UAS oriented RF

• RF jamming has similar characteristics to electromagnetic
wave. So once the target is determined, how to transmit
the jamming signal to a speciﬁc position is an issue.
The directional antenna could send the electromagnetic
wave into the speciﬁc area, but it still needs to realize
the speciﬁc points attack. The phase array radar maybe
a good direction for further investigation. A RF jam-
ming array may include the omni-directional antennas
and directional antennas. The control ends change the
RF jamming transmitting power and phase to realize a
combination of RF jamming in a speciﬁc position.

• The RF jamming is easy to realize but how to recognize
the target communication channels is also an open prob-
lem. The surveillance ofﬁcials could eavesdrop the target
UAS communication and determine its communication
channels. With the recognition of communication, the
defenders just execute the RF jamming in the speciﬁc
channels and the energy on the invalid jamming channels
will be saved.

4) Hacking: Hacking UAS has been investigated for many
years. The hacking methods mainly focus on outer interfer-
ence, networking, and spooﬁng.

• The current outer interference requires that the interfer-
ence devices are very close to the UAS sensors (like IMU,
GPS) so that the UAS could get the correct data from the
sensors. The remote interference devices and approaches
are needed to lead the UAS to ﬂy away from the sensitive
area in a long distance.

• The network using on UAS are mainly WiFi and cellular
networks. One way is to attack the WiFi and cellular
networks of the UAS to obtain the priority of the UAS,

and send command to autopilot to lead the UAS to
launch off in a safe place. Also, the defenders could
leverage network to access the link and play the man-
in-the-middle, decrypt the communication packet of the
command, and then modify the command to control the
target to launch or ﬂy back where it comes. There are
also another approach to allow the cellular operators to
request authentication on the cellular link to check the
commands on the ﬂight randomly.

• There are some other sensors that the researches have
not tried yet like optical ﬂow, camera and laser. The
optical ﬂow sensors are leveraged to locate the position
of the UAS, so that the UAS could navigate itself to the
destination. The image matching technology enable the
UAS to leverage the cameras to get the destinations. The
laser sensors are also a powerful tool to get location and
navigation for the UAS. Novel approaches are needed to
interfere and spoof these sensors or invalid these functions
to force the UAS to get back.

• The UAS controlled by radio communicate with each
end device with protocols. There is a need to recognize
the protocol used by the autopilot and communication
devices. Because this approach could enable the ofﬁcials
to determine the parameters of the communication and
attack the command link used by the pilots on the ground.
At the same time, the recognition approach could be
executed in the SDR so that the surveillance UAS could
leverage the SDR to decrypt the communication packet
and modify the ﬂight conﬁguration to return.

VI. FUTURE TRENDS
A. Technical advancements

As discussed above, simple detection approaches cannot
get a reliable rate of detecting malicious UAS successfully.
On one hand, each simple approach has its disadvantages so
the simple detection sensor could not meet all the detection
requirements in a variable environment; on the other hand,
the UAS designed with different materials and conﬁgurations
also pose a big challenge for simple detection sensors to
capture. The future UAS detection approaches would be more
mature, practical and efﬁcient. The detection schemes need to
be combined from multiple sensors and fused with ground
data and aerial data collaboratively. The diversity and the
amount of data in types of detection and acquisition space
could be a trend to improve. Similar to detection schemes,
simple negation approaches also could not satisfy negation
requirement, especially the countermeasures could not damage
the property of the pilots. Future negation schemes should
focus on navigating the intruding UAS to ﬂy away the sensitive
areas and no harm to the property of pilots. Of course,
the different countermeasures are promising to achieve better
performance when they are implemented collaboratively. That
means how to construct a uniﬁed and systematic framework for
the UAS safety defense also is a challenge in the following
stages. What’s more, a UAS safety defense system includes
detection and negation, so how to balance the two parts in a
collaborative and uniﬁed framework is also a research focus.

B. Industrial Standards

Most security and safety problems are caused by the peo-
ple’s mistaking operation. The detailed operation and manage-
ment policy could be helpful to people to avoid the mistakes
and reduce the burden of the defenders. These policies not
only serve as guidance to the pilots, but also standards to the
industries. A guidance allows the pilots to make awareness of
ﬂight of UAS in safety and security and avoid the mistaking
operations when the UAS is on the ﬂight. The industrial
standards make it possible to stop the UAS when it is out
of control.

• The industrial standards need the market entrance stan-
dards which limit the UAS on the market to be control-
lable and identiﬁed in a physical level. Once the UAS
are instructing in restricted areas, the defenders could be
able to access the system in physical level to drive away
or stop the UAS remotely.

• The basic training for pilots needs to include the safety
operations and security knowledge. The speciﬁcation of
UAS operation training and certiﬁcation could help pilots
avoid basic mistakes.

C. Uniﬁed and Secured Coordination Strategies

The discussion above shows that it is hard to protect the
public from unsafe and unauthorized drone operations by using
one single approach. Therefore, we propose a uniﬁed frame-
work of collaborative UAS safety management, as shown in
Fig. 13. The collaborated entities for UAS safety management
are:

1) Local UAS coordinator: The local UAS authorities
[2] are responsible for making use of all interfaces
provided by UAS manufactures to secure the operation
of UAS and handing over UAS within coordinator when
necessary. Obviously this is a distributed management
paradigm [10].
2) Existing airspace authorities: Existing airspace man-
agement authorities are not required to deal with UAS
directly. It is desired for airspace management authori-
ties to interact with the regulation database and release
information to the shared data cube [7], [1], which is
supposed to shared with local UAS coordinators friendly.
The key information can be visualized to ﬁgure out
the status of UAS management quickly and effectively.
Apart from the data sharing, the authorities are supposed
to maintenance the security and the integrity of the
releasing data in case modiﬁed by attackers. Right before
the publication of this paper, we do notice that FAA
has released a mobile App to graphically display where
drone operation is allowed as well as speciﬁc rules to
follow [115].

3) UAS manufacturers: Manufacturers are responsible for
specifying the minimal environmental requirement for
proper manipulation [9] of UAS. Meanwhile, they are
required to provide privileged control interfaces for local
UAS coordinators [29] to interrupt and re-accommodate
UAS when necessary. Detect and avoid (DAA) technolo-
gies will play an important role in overcoming barriers to
UAS integration [116], [117], [118], [119], [120], [121].
4) Local UAS coordinators:
This entity interacts as an
agent between UAS users and airspace authorities, they
are responsible for providing proper guidelines for UAS
users and make use of privileged control interfaces to
assure that UAS operations comply with issued regula-
tions.
5) Trusted
information
provider:
The
information
providers are responsible for: a) providing the whole
framework with safety and security related information.
b) reviewing the report submitted from residents [6].
Within our proposed framework, UAS operations are within
the supervision of local UAS coordinators and UAS manufac-
tures. The residents could achieve a more secure and safe life
under a harmony management of the UAS trafﬁc environment.

#### VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In addition to recreational use, unmanned aircraft systems
(UAS), also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or
drones, are used across our world to support ﬁreﬁghting and
search and rescue operations, to monitor and assess critical
infrastructure, to provide disaster relief by transporting emer-
gency medical supplies to remote locations, and to aid efforts
to secure our borders. However, UAS can also be used for
malicious schemes by terrorists, criminal organizations, and
lone actors with speciﬁc objectives. To promote safe, secure
and privacy-respecting UAS operations, there is an urgent need
for innovative technologies for detecting and mitigating UAS.
Over the past 5 years, signiﬁcant research efforts have been
made to counter UAS: detection technologies are based on
acoustic, vision, passive radio frequency, or data fusion; and
mitigation technologies include physical capture or jamming.
In this paper, we provided a comprehensive survey of exist-
ing literature in the area of UAS detection and mitigation,
identiﬁed the challenges in countering unauthorized or unsafe
UAS, and evaluated the trends of detection and mitigation
for protecting against UAS-based threats. We envision that an
integrated system capable of detecting and mitigating UAS
will be essential to the safe integration of UAS into the
airspace system.
